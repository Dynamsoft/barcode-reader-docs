# Dynamsoft Barcode Reader - JavaScript Documentation

The JavaScript edition of the [Dynamsoft Barcode Reader](https://www.dynamsoft.com/barcode-reader/overview/) allows developers to easily integrate fast and accurate barcode scanning in their web applications, while also offering their users a breadth of runtime settings to help optimize the scanner to their specific use case or desired performance. This documentation offers a detailed walkthrough on how to integrate the Dynamsoft Barcode Reader with your own application in the `User Guide`, on top of an `API Reference` guide and a `Sample Gallery` that are useful references throughout the development process.
